# CST205Project
Project Name: Wakestart

Project Description: Our project is designed to make the user's morning more efficient. Wakestart will  wake the user with a common alarm sound to make sure the user wakes up. In order for the alarm to stop, the user has to hit the usual stop button. From there, the user will be shown the weather forecast depending on the location and what outfits to wear depending on the temperature for the day.
